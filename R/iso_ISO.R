  #
  # NEW COUNTRY TEMPLATE
  # This is a template to extend this package with a new country
  #
  # Copy this template in a new file
  # Rename the file with the ISO code of the country (iso_ISO.R)
  # Rename this function with the ISO code of the country
  #
  # You can find ISO codes here:
  # https://github.com/covid19datahub/COVID19/blob/master/inst/extdata/db/ISO.csv
  #
  # The function must include the arguments 'level' and 'cache'. See:
  # https://github.com/covid19datahub/COVID19/blob/master/R/covid19.R
  # The function cannot include additional arguments
  # The function must return a data.frame
  #
  # When implemented, rebuild the package and test the function by running:
  #  covid19("ISO", level = 1) 
  # where "ISO" is the name of this function and level = 1,2,3.
